# Step 9

Implement monitoring 
- Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the Docker Compose setup.

# Step 8 

- Use Docker Gordon to create a topology diagram of the Docker Compose setup.
- Draw with mermaid syntax to visualize the architecture.

Prompt:
```
show my network topology, including names, ip, services and relationships
```

Output 

```
Here is your network topology including container names, IP addresses, services, and their relationships within the Docker networks:

1. Network: bridge (default)
   - No containers currently connected.

2. Network: host
   - Containers (mostly Kubernetes pods) with no specific IP addresses assigned here:
     - kube-proxy-4z9pw (kube-system)
     - etcd-docker-desktop (kube-system)
     - kube-scheduler-docker-desktop (kube-system)
     - kube-controller-manager-docker-desktop (kube-system)
     - kube-apiserver-docker-desktop (kube-system)

3. Network: none
   - Containers (Kubernetes pods) with no IP addresses:
     - coredns-668d6bf9bc-2rrff (kube-system)
     - storage-provisioner (kube-system)
     - vpnkit-controller (kube-system)
     - coredns-668d6bf9bc-dzwzd (kube-system)

4. Network: wordpress-mariadb-redis_wp_network
   - Subnet: 172.18.0.0/16, Gateway: 172.18.0.1
   - Containers and their IPs:
     - redis-1-1: 172.18.0.3 (Redis service)
     - redis-2-1: 172.18.0.2 (Redis service)
     - redis-exporter-2-1: 172.18.0.6 (Redis metrics exporter)
     - redis-exporter-1-1: 172.18.0.5 (Redis metrics exporter)
     - nginx-exporter-1: 172.18.0.12 (Nginx metrics exporter)
     - grafana-1: 172.18.0.14 (Grafana monitoring)
     - wordpress-3-1: 172.18.0.10 (WordPress service)
     - wordpress-2-1: 172.18.0.8 (WordPress service)
     - wordpress-1-1: 172.18.0.11 (WordPress service)
     - nginx-1: 172.18.0.7 (Nginx web server)
     - mariadb-1: 172.18.0.4 (MariaDB database)
     - phpmyadmin-1: 172.18.0.9 (phpMyAdmin for DB management)
     - prometheus-1: 172.18.0.13 (Prometheus monitoring)

Relationships:
- WordPress containers connect to MariaDB (172.18.0.4) for database services.
- Redis containers provide caching services.
- Nginx acts as a web server/load balancer for WordPress.
- Prometheus and Grafana provide monitoring and metrics visualization.
- Exporters (redis-exporter, nginx-exporter) expose metrics to Prometheus.

If you want, I can provide a visual diagram or more detailed service descriptions.

# Step 1

Generate a Docker Compose YAML file that sets up three services:

1.  **WordPress:** Use the latest stable WordPress image from Docker Hub. Expose port 80.
2.  **MariaDB:** Use the latest stable MariaDB image from Docker Hub to serve as the database for WordPress. Configure it with a simple root password, database name, user, and password suitable for local development (e.g., 'wordpress' for all). Persist the database data using a named volume.
3.  **phpMyAdmin:** Use the latest stable phpMyAdmin image from Docker Hub. Link it to the MariaDB service and configure it to connect using the credentials set for the WordPress database user. Expose port 8080.

Ensure the services are configured to communicate with each other (WordPress and phpMyAdmin connecting to MariaDB) using their service names. The setup should be suitable for a local development environment.

Save the Docker Compose file as `docker-compose-.yml` and include comments explaining each section of the configuration.

# Step 2

Write INSTRUCTIONS for using the Docker Compose file. Include steps for starting the services, accessing WordPress and phpMyAdmin, and stopping the services. Make sure to mention any prerequisites, such as having Docker and Docker Compose installed on the local machine.

# Step 3

Run docker compose up -d to start the services in detached mode. Verify that all services are running correctly using docker-compose ps. If any service fails to start, check the logs using docker-compose logs <service_name> for troubleshooting.

# Step 4
Create a README.md file that includes the following sections:
- **Project Overview:** Briefly describe the purpose of the Docker Compose setup.
- **Prerequisites:** List the requirements for running the setup, including Docker and Docker Compose versions.
- **Usage Instructions:** Provide detailed steps for using the Docker Compose file, including starting and stopping the services.
- **Accessing Services:** Explain how to access WordPress and phpMyAdmin through the web browser.
- **Troubleshooting:** Include common issues and their solutions, such as service not starting or connection errors.
- **License:** Specify the license under which the project is distributed (e.g., MIT License).

# Step 5
Create a LICENSE file with the text of the chosen license (e.g., MIT License). Ensure that the license is compatible with the project and allows for redistribution and modification.

# Step 6
Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from version control. Include common entries for Docker projects, such as:
```
# Ignore Docker-related files
docker-compose.override.yml
docker-compose.local.yml
```

# Step 7

Update README.md to describe Additional Configuration and services
