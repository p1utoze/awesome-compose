# Step XX (new project): Plan for migration to Kubernetes for auto-scaling and zero-downtime deployments.

# Step 14 

Ask Docker Gordon 

- show sizes of images/containers/services in my docker compose
- show memory usage for all services in my docker compose
- show disk usage for all services in my docker compose

# Step 13

Implement MariaDB and Redis clustering for high availability and performance.

MariaDB Master/Replica Architecture
Approach 1: MariaDB Galera Cluster

This is a synchronous multi-master cluster that provides:

No single point of failure
No slave lag
Read/write to any node
Automatic node provisioning

Redis Master/Replica Architecture
Redis Sentinel
Monitors master and replica instances
Automatic failover if master goes down
Promotes a replica to master
Notifies clients about the new master
Redis Cluster
Automatic partitioning across multiple nodes
Continues operations when subset of nodes are experiencing failures
Linear scalability up to 1000 nodes

# Step 12 

Automate backups for MariaDB and persistent volumes.

scripts saved under `scripts/` directory:

This includes: 
- `backup.sh`: Script to create backups of MariaDB databases, WordPress uploads, Redis data, and Grafana data.
- `restore.sh`: Script to restore from backups.
- `setup-cron.sh`: Script to set up a cron job for automated backups.

# Step 11 

`compose.yaml`: Use fixed versions for grafana, prometheus, and nginx-exporter (and other exporters) to ensure stability in production. Update the Docker Compose file to pin these images to specific versions instead of using `latest`. 

# Step 10: Enterprise-Readiness Review (Performance, Security, Architecture)

## 1. Performance
- Use Alpine-based, version-pinned images for all services (already done).
- Optimize Dockerfiles with multi-stage builds (already done for WordPress/phpMyAdmin).
- Use Redis for object caching (already implemented). For production, consider a shared Redis cluster.
- For high traffic, use MariaDB with primary/replica setup and connection pooling. Consider managed DB services.
- Use production-grade storage (NFS, cloud block storage) for volumes, not just local driver.
- Offload static assets to a CDN and configure WordPress to use CDN URLs for media.
- Add Docker healthchecks to all critical services.

## 2. Security
- Restrict service-to-service communication using multiple networks or network aliases. Only expose necessary ports.
- Use real SSL certificates (not self-signed) for NGINX in production. Automate renewal (e.g., Let's Encrypt).
- Run containers as non-root users where possible. Drop unnecessary Linux capabilities.
- Regularly update base images and plugins to patch vulnerabilities.
- Do not expose phpMyAdmin in production or restrict access via firewall/VPN.
- Secure Prometheus and Grafana with authentication and restrict external access.

## 3. Architecture (Keep It Simple)
- Keep a single compose file for clarity. For production, consider splitting dev/prod configs.
- Use Compose overrides or Swarm/Kubernetes for horizontal scaling. For enterprise scale, migrate to Kubernetes.
- Automate backups for MariaDB and persistent volumes.
- Continue using Prometheus and Grafana. Add alerting rules for critical metrics.
- Keep architecture, scaling, and troubleshooting docs up to date.

## Actionable Next Steps

1. ~~Implement Docker healthchecks for all services.~~ DONE.
2. ~~Move secrets to Docker secrets or .env files (never commit secrets)~~. DONE.
3. Use production storage drivers for volumes.
4. Restrict phpMyAdmin and monitoring UIs to trusted IPs.
5. Automate SSL certificate renewal.
6. Plan for migration to Kubernetes if you need auto-scaling and zero-downtime deployments.

# Step 9

Implement monitoring 
- Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the Docker Compose setup.

# Step 8 

- Use Docker Gordon to create a topology diagram of the Docker Compose setup.
- Draw with mermaid syntax to visualize the architecture.

Prompt:
```
show my network topology, including names, ip, services and relationships.
generate a mermaid diagram for network topology.
```

(Simple prompt)
```
generate a mermaid diagram of the docker compose setup.
```

Output 

```
Here is your network topology including container names, IP addresses, services, and their relationships within the Docker networks:


<!-- 1. Network: bridge (default)
   - No containers currently connected.

2. Network: host
   - Containers (mostly Kubernetes pods) with no specific IP addresses assigned here:
     - kube-proxy-4z9pw (kube-system)
     - etcd-docker-desktop (kube-system)
     - kube-scheduler-docker-desktop (kube-system)
     - kube-controller-manager-docker-desktop (kube-system)
     - kube-apiserver-docker-desktop (kube-system)
 -->

3. Network: none
   - Containers (Kubernetes pods) with no IP addresses:
     - coredns-668d6bf9bc-2rrff (kube-system)
     - storage-provisioner (kube-system)
     - vpnkit-controller (kube-system)
     - coredns-668d6bf9bc-dzwzd (kube-system)

4. Network: wordpress-mariadb-redis_wp_network
   - Subnet: 172.18.0.0/16, Gateway: 172.18.0.1
   - Containers and their IPs:
     - redis-1-1: 172.18.0.3 (Redis service)
     - redis-2-1: 172.18.0.2 (Redis service)
     - redis-exporter-2-1: 172.18.0.6 (Redis metrics exporter)
     - redis-exporter-1-1: 172.18.0.5 (Redis metrics exporter)
     - nginx-exporter-1: 172.18.0.12 (Nginx metrics exporter)
     - grafana-1: 172.18.0.14 (Grafana monitoring)
     - wordpress-3-1: 172.18.0.10 (WordPress service)
     - wordpress-2-1: 172.18.0.8 (WordPress service)
     - wordpress-1-1: 172.18.0.11 (WordPress service)
     - nginx-1: 172.18.0.7 (Nginx web server)
     - mariadb-1: 172.18.0.4 (MariaDB database)
     - phpmyadmin-1: 172.18.0.9 (phpMyAdmin for DB management)
     - prometheus-1: 172.18.0.13 (Prometheus monitoring)

Relationships:
- WordPress containers connect to MariaDB (172.18.0.4) for database services.
- Redis containers provide caching services.
- Nginx acts as a web server/load balancer for WordPress.
- Prometheus and Grafana provide monitoring and metrics visualization.
- Exporters (redis-exporter, nginx-exporter) expose metrics to Prometheus.

If you want, I can provide a visual diagram or more detailed service descriptions.
```

# Step 7

Update README.md to describe Additional Configuration and services

# Step 6

Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from version control. Include common entries for Docker projects, such as:
```
# Ignore Docker-related files
docker-compose.override.yml
docker-compose.local.yml
```

# Step 5
Create a LICENSE file with the text of the chosen license (e.g., MIT License). Ensure that the license is compatible with the project and allows for redistribution and modification.

# Step 4
Create a README.md file that includes the following sections:
- **Project Overview:** Briefly describe the purpose of the Docker Compose setup.
- **Prerequisites:** List the requirements for running the setup, including Docker and Docker Compose versions.
- **Usage Instructions:** Provide detailed steps for using the Docker Compose file, including starting and stopping the services.
- **Accessing Services:** Explain how to access WordPress and phpMyAdmin through the web browser.
- **Troubleshooting:** Include common issues and their solutions, such as service not starting or connection errors.
- **License:** Specify the license under which the project is distributed (e.g., MIT License).

# Step 3

Run docker compose up -d to start the services in detached mode. Verify that all services are running correctly using docker-compose ps. If any service fails to start, check the logs using docker-compose logs <service_name> for troubleshooting.


# Step 2

Write INSTRUCTIONS for using the Docker Compose file. Include steps for starting the services, accessing WordPress and phpMyAdmin, and stopping the services. Make sure to mention any prerequisites, such as having Docker and Docker Compose installed on the local machine.



# Step 1

Generate a Docker Compose YAML file that sets up three services:

1.  **WordPress:** Use the latest stable WordPress image from Docker Hub. Expose port 80.
2.  **MariaDB:** Use the latest stable MariaDB image from Docker Hub to serve as the database for WordPress. Configure it with a simple root password, database name, user, and password suitable for local development (e.g., 'wordpress' for all). Persist the database data using a named volume.
3.  **phpMyAdmin:** Use the latest stable phpMyAdmin image from Docker Hub. Link it to the MariaDB service and configure it to connect using the credentials set for the WordPress database user. Expose port 8080.

Ensure the services are configured to communicate with each other (WordPress and phpMyAdmin connecting to MariaDB) using their service names. The setup should be suitable for a local development environment.

Save the Docker Compose file as `docker-compose-.yml` and include comments explaining each section of the configuration.
