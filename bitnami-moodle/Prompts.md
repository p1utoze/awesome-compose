# Step 1 

Generate a Docker Compose YAML file to set up a Moodle development environment. The environment should include three services using official Bitnami container images from Docker Hub:

1.  **Moodle:** Use the latest stable `docker.io/bitnami/moodle` image. Configure it to connect to the MariaDB service. Expose port 80 (mapped to host port 80) and port 443 (mapped to host port 443). Use named volumes for `/bitnami/moodle` and `/bitnami/moodledata` for data persistence.
2.  **MariaDB:** Use the latest stable `docker.io/bitnami/mariadb` image. Set environment variables to allow empty passwords for simplicity (suitable for local development) and define a database user, password, and database name (e.g., using `ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes`). Use a named volume for `/bitnami/mariadb` for data persistence.
3.  **phpMyAdmin:** Use the latest stable `docker.io/bitnami/phpmyadmin` image. Configure it to connect to the MariaDB service using its service name and the appropriate port and database credentials. Expose port 8080 (mapped to host port 8080).

Ensure all services are connected via a common bridge network defined within the Compose file. The Moodle and phpMyAdmin services should depend on the MariaDB service. Explicitly define the named volumes using the `volumes:` section at the top level. Do not require building a custom Dockerfile for the Moodle service; use the standard Bitnami image directly.

# Step 1.1

Review and update the prompt above using GPTs.

# Step 2

Write INSTRUCTIONS for using the Docker Compose file. Include steps for starting the services, accessing WordPress and phpMyAdmin, and stopping the services. Make sure to mention any prerequisites, such as having Docker and Docker Compose installed on the local machine.

# Step 3

Run docker compose up -d to start the services in detached mode. Verify that all services are running correctly using docker-compose ps. If any service fails to start, check the logs using docker-compose logs <service_name> for troubleshooting.

# Step 4
Create a README.md file that includes the following sections:
- **Project Overview:** Briefly describe the purpose of the Docker Compose setup.
- **Prerequisites:** List the requirements for running the setup, including Docker and Docker Compose versions.
- **Usage Instructions:** Provide detailed steps for using the Docker Compose file, including starting and stopping the services.
- **Accessing Services:** Explain how to access WordPress and phpMyAdmin through the web browser.
- **Troubleshooting:** Include common issues and their solutions, such as service not starting or connection errors.
- **License:** Specify the license under which the project is distributed (e.g., MIT License).

# Step 5
Create a LICENSE file with the text of the chosen license (e.g., MIT License). Ensure that the license is compatible with the project and allows for redistribution and modification.

# Step 6
Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from version control. Include common entries for Docker projects, such as:
```
# Ignore Docker-related files
docker-compose.override.yml
docker-compose.local.yml
```

# Step 7

Update README.md to describe Additional Configuration and services

# Create a migration script to generate sample data for the database

The script should include the following tables:
- users
- courses
- enrollments
- assignments
- grades
- forums
- posts
- comments
- quizzes
- question_bank
